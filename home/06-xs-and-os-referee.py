''' 06. --- Xs and Os Referee --- Simple

Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two 
players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks 
in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) 
wins the game.

But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee 
for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must 
determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be 
the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the 
O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

A game's result is presented as a list of strings, 
where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.

Input:              A game result as a list of strings (unicode).
Output:             "X", "O" or "D" as a string.
How it is used:     The concepts in this task will help you when 
                    iterating data types. They can also be used 
                    in game algorithms, allowing you to know how 
                    to check results.
