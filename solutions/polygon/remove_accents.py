""" --- Remove Accents --- Simple

Assuming you are developing a user based system like facebook,
you will want to provide the functionality to search for other
members regardless of the presence of accents in a username.
Without using 3rd party collation library, you will need to remove
the accents from username before comparison.

Ã© - letter with accent; e - letter without accent;

Input:              A phrase as a string (unicode)
Output:             An accent free Unicode string.
How it is used:     It might be a part username verification process
                    or system that propose username based on first
                    and last name of user
Precondition:       0<=|input|<=40
